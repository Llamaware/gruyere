## Features

### 1. **Totally Real User Accounts**
Create an account that you can **definitely** use! With our revolutionary fake authentication system, you can enter any username and password you can imagine. Who needs security when you have imagination? 

### 2. **Snippets Galore!**
Why write a novel when you can create tiny, adorable snippets? Share your thoughts in 140 characters or less (because this isn‚Äôt Twitter, but we‚Äôre totally down to steal ideas). Add, edit, or delete snippets as much as your heart desires‚Äîjust don‚Äôt expect anyone to read them!

### 3. **User Profiles That Exist‚Ä¶ Somewhere**
Customize your profile with a username, password, and maybe a picture of a cat. It‚Äôs a profile, it‚Äôs real, and it‚Äôs all yours (until you forget your login). But hey, who wouldn‚Äôt want a profile filled with *fake* data about a *fake* user?

### 4. **Delete Snippets with a Click!**
Feeling particularly ruthless? You can delete snippets as easily as you can delete your dignity after a bad pun! Just click the [X] and watch your words vanish into the digital ether‚Äîpoof! Just like your last relationship!

### 5. **Admin Powers! (Sort Of)**
Ever wanted to be a fake admin? Well, now you can! With our super-exclusive "admin" features, you can pretend to manage a website that doesn't really exist. Feel the rush of authority without any of the responsibility!

### 6. **Snippets for Everyone!**
Share your creativity with the world (or at least with yourself). Our snippets feature is designed for those who love to express themselves without worrying about pesky things like coherence or logic. **Cheese-themed snippets encouraged!**

### 7. **No Server? No Problem!**
Our ‚Äúserver‚Äù has a fantastic feature: it doesn‚Äôt exist! That‚Äôs right, no downtime, no maintenance, and best of all, no annoying updates. Just pure, unadulterated fake content. Enjoy your stay while it lasts!

2. **Open it in Your Browser**: Just run `python server.py`, open a browser at `localhost:8000`, and watch the magic unfold. No need for a server‚Äîjust your trusty browser, pretending this is real.

3. **Create an Account**: Enter a username, a password, and prepare to be amazed by the stunning lack of verification.

4. **Start Snipping!**: Share your most profound thoughts, or simply post your grocery list. It‚Äôs all in good fun!
